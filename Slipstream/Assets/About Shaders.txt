Ok so I am putting this note here because the Shaders folder deals with official Hopoo Games shaders. If you are not dealing with shaders,
making visual effects, or making stages (or anything similar) DO NOT touch the folder. However, if you are theres a few concerns.

-If you got your hands on the official hgshaders via GameImporter (they must have the .asset suffix. If its .shader it doesn't work.) just drop them in their
respective meta file locations.
-If you are working with shaders, make sure  to swap the materials using the shaders back to the stubbed version when building the mod,
I have yet to create a custom pipeline to circumvent this.
